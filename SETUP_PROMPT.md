## 📋 Setup Prompt for GitHub Copilot

```
Hi! I've just cloned the ntwanaAfrika educational platform repository and received the .env.local file with all the API keys. This is a Next.js 14 app with Firebase authentication, Google Maps integration, and AI tutoring features.

Please help me set up and run this project properly by:

1. **Installing Dependencies**: Set up all required packages using npm/pnpm
2. **Environment Configuration**: Verify the .env.local file is properly placed and configured
3. **Firebase Setup**: Ensure Firebase authentication and services are working
4. **Development Server**: Start the Next.js development server
5. **API Verification**: Test that Google Maps and Gemini AI APIs are functioning
6. **Troubleshooting**: Fix any setup issues that arise

The project includes:
- Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Firebase Authentication (email/password, Google OAuth, anonymous)
- Google Maps Platform integration for location-based rewards
- Google Gemini AI for tutoring features
- Comprehensive authentication system with protected routes
- Mobile-responsive navigation with logout functionality

Please guide me through the complete setup process step by step, check for any errors, and make sure everything is working before I start development.
```

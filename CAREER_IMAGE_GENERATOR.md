## AI Services Integration

### Current Implementation (Demo)

- Uses placeholder images with career-specific styling
- Gemini AI creates detailed prompts for image generation
- Simulates the full workflow without actual image generation

### Production Ready Integrations

The API is structured to easily integrate with real image generation services:

#### Option 1: OpenAI DALL-E 3 (Recommended)

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

- Highest quality results
- Best at following detailed prompts
- Professional and realistic outputs

#### Option 2: Stable Diffusion (Open Source)

```env
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_token
```

- Cost-effective option
- Highly customizable
- Good quality results

#### Option 3: HuggingFace (Free Tier Available)

```env
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_key
```

- Free tier available
- Multiple model options
- Good for experimentation

## Environment Variables

Required for full functionality:

```env
# Google Gemini AI (for prompt generation and image analysis)
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key

# Optional: Image Generation Service (choose one)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key          # For DALL-E 3

## Development

To enable real image generation:

2. Add the appropriate API key to your environment
3. Uncomment the relevant generation function in `/app/api/generate-career-image/route.ts`
4. Update the API call to use the real generation service

The current placeholder implementation provides a complete user experience while you set up your preferred AI image generation service.
